# Treehouse personal profile page
First project for treehouse web development tech degree

Customized a personal online profile by adding graphics, updating text, and improving the look of the web page using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).


## Overview 
For this project, I practiced my web design skills by editing HTML elements and their styles. With the HTML and CSS already provided, I was asked to add, edit, and remove the pre-existing code and make it my own.

## Skills
- HTML
- CSS

## Conclusion
This project also gave me a web page that I can use as a personal online portfolio to advertise my experience, skills, and goals.
